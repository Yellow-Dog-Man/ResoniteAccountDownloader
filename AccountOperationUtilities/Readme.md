# AccountOperationUtilities
We might need other utilities for other platforms or locations in the future, this Library is meant to contain interfaces that allow for this more easily. 

It's largely a big todo, but I want to move more of the Avalonia app into this library in the future. It also let me unify and simplify the Generator code a little bit.

Basically TODO.
